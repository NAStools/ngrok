## authtoken
#
# This option specifies the authentication token used to authenticate this
# client when it connects to the ngrok.com service. After you've created an
# ngrok.com account, your dashboard will display the authtoken assigned to your
# account.
#
# authtoken:

## region
#
# Choose the region where the ngrok client will connect to host its tunnels.
#
# us (United States)
# eu (Europe)
# ap (Asia/Pacific)
# au (Australia)
#
# region: us

## console_ui
#
# true: enable the console UI
# false: disable the console UI
# iftty: enable the UI only if standard out is a TTY (not a file or pipe)
#
# console_ui: true

# compress_conn: false

## http_proxy
#
# URL of an HTTP proxy to use for establishing the tunnel connection. Many HTTP
# proxies have connection size and duration limits that will cause ngrok to
# fail. Like many other networking tools, ngrok will also respect the
# environment variable http_proxy if it is set.
#
# http_proxy: "http://user:password@proxy.company:3128"
# http_proxy: false

## inspect_db_size
#
# positive integers: size in bytes of the upper limit on memory to allocate to
#                    save requests over HTTP tunnels for inspection and replay.
# 0: use the default allocation limit, 50MB
# -1: disable the inspection database; this has the effective behavior of
#     disabling inspection for all tunnels
#
# inspect_db_size: 0

## log_level
#
# Logging level of detail. In increasing order of verbosity, possible values
# are: crit,warn,error,info,debug
#
# log_level: info

## log_format
#
# Format of written log records.
#
# logfmt: human and machine friendly key/value pairs
# json: newline-separated JSON objects
# term: custom colored human format if standard out is a TTY, otherwise same as
#       logfmt
#
# log_format: json

## log
# Write logs to this target destination.
#
# stdout: write to standard out
# stderr: write to standard error
# false: disable logging
# other values: write log records to file path on disk
#
# log: /apps/nastools-ngrok/ngrok.log

## metadata
# Opaque, user-supplied string that will be returned as part of the ngrok.com
# API response to the List Online Tunnels resource for all tunnels started by
# this client. This is a useful mechanism to identify tunnels by your own
# device or customer identifier. Maximum 4096 characters.
#
# metadata: '{"serial": "00012xa-33rUtz9", "comment": "For customer alan@example.com"}'

## root_cas
#
# The root certificate authorities used to validate the TLS connection to the
# ngrok server.
#
# trusted: use only the trusted certificate root for the ngrok.com tunnel
#          service
# host: use the root certificates trusted by the host's operating system. You
#       will likely want to use this option to connect to third-party ngrok
#       servers.
# other values: path to a certificate PEM file on disk with certificate
#               authorities to trust
#
# root_cas: trusted

## socks5_proxy
#
# URL of a SOCKS5 proxy to use for establishing a connection to the ngrok
# server.
#
# socks5_proxy: "socks5://localhost:9150"

## update
#
# true: automatically update ngrok to the latest version, when available
# false: never update ngrok unless manually initiated by the user
# update: true

## update_channel
#
# The update channel determines the stability of released builds to update to.
# Use 'stable' for all production deployments.
#
# stable: update to new stable builds when available
# beta: update to new beta builds when available
#
update_channel: beta

## web_addr
#
# Network address to bind on for serving the local web interface and api.
#
# web_addr: localhost:4040

## Sample tunnel configuration
#tunnels:
# website:
#   addr: 8888
#   auth: bob:bobpassword
#   bind_tls: true
#   host_header: "myapp.dev"
#   inspect: false
#   proto: http
#   subdomain: myapp

# e2etls:
#   addr: 9000

#   hostname: myapp.example.com

#   key: example.key
# 
# ssh-access:
#   addr: 22
#   proto: tcp
#   remote_addr: 1.tcp.ngrok.io:12345

# If you remove or rename the default NASadmin tunnel, please be sure to modify
# the systemd service @
#   /lib/systemd/system/fvapp-nastools-ngrok.service
#   /apps/nastools-ngrok/fvapp-nastools-ngrok.service
# to point to the new tunnel name.
# ngrok REQUIRES a configured tunnel to start.
